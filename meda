Data Cleaning IS Analysis, Not Grunt Work
TL;DR: Cleaning data is considered by some people [citation needed] to be menial work that’s somehow “beneath” the sexy “real” data science work. I call BS. The act of cleaning data imposes values/judgments/interpretations upon data intended to allow downstream analysis algorithms to function and give results. That’s exactly the same as doing data analysis. In fact, “cleaning” is just a spectrum of reusable data transformations on the path towards doing a full data analysis. Once we accept that framework, the steps we need to take to clean data flow more naturally. We want to allow our analysis code to run, control useless variance, eliminate bias, and document for others to use, all in service to the array of potential analyses we want to run in the future.

It’s Thursday already (short weeks are the worst) and I once again asked people on Twitter if anyone had ideas for stuff I should be writing about. One response I got back was: “Cleaning”. Seriously, that was it.

At first I thought that was asking a bit much. Data cleaning is an age-old topic, what could I write in a newsletter that would contribute anything at all to the conversation?

Then I started looking at existing articles about data cleaning… and it got annoying. There’s a mountain of stuff all trying to sound authoritative and saying the same things. But as a practitioner, I can see it’s not useful. It’s like the infuriating “is left as an exercise to the reader” in textbooks. Last time I got this annoyed at a tech writing topic, it spawned a monster SQL optimization post.

Then, I started seriously thinking about data cleaning as a concept, and fell down an entire epistemological rabbit hole.

So let’s get started.

Existing Data Cleaning writing is pretty useless
First let’s start with stating the problem with existing writing on “Data Cleaning”.

Wikipedia’s post on data cleaning does a decent summary of the big important qualities of data quality: Validity, Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency, Uniformity. It’s also got a section on “process” that’s really dry and academic (in a negative way) and won’t help you clean any data at all.

Next I’m just gonna sample posts from the top links on Google when I search “Data cleaning”. I’ll provide links as reference so you know what I’m griping about.

This highly PageRanked one is like a friendlier expansion of the Wikipedia page at the start. Luckily it redeems itself in the process section by listing a big list of example techniques to use to clean data, things like cleaning spaces, dropping irrelevant values, etc. Has some examples and illustrations!

This one is some random blog-like post for some data product site I’ve never heard of. It’s short and mostly “data quality is important, you need to monitor it on an ongoing basis”. They’re not wrong, but also not that helpful. Then they give a process loop for cleaning, verifying, and monitoring your data… I assume this is because they’re selling you some of this functionality in the product.

Next, Tableau gets in on the repetition game, saying why clean data is important, listing out a similar checklist of steps, and tacked on the end are those qualities of data quality! Not bad, but remarkably similar to the other entries thus far.

This one on a data science education site says things like “Good data > Fancier algorithms”, also cartoon pictures of robots (I like cute things), so that’s a plus. Then it’s right off to the checklists, remove bad observations, fix errors, fill in missing values, etc. I sorta get their “selling” skills here, but still.

Pattern-spotting brain senses pattern!

If you want a highly ranked Data Cleaning post just take the concepts of “Data quality is important”, “Audit data, find errors, fix them, monitor, repeat”, and “here’s the qualities of good data quality”. Toss in a few examples. Do it in < 1,000 words.

Profit! (Literally, through ads and product sales)

My biggest gripe is that these are all shallow checklists of “Go find the bad stuff and clean it! Use these tools/techniques. Easy!” If it were so easy, we wouldn’t be spending so much time doing it. You’re often handed a list of “Good data has these qualities” so just go look at your data and just make sure it has them. If not, find a way to impose those qualities upon the data. Meanwhile every reader is thinking, “so, how?”

Side Note: There’s some better discussions if you search for “Data cleaning theory”.

There’s also efforts to automate data cleaning (usually with the help of AI because obviously AI makes everything better). Part of these efforts stems towards there being just too darned much data and humans can’t possibly analyze all of it. But the these products/functions are also aimed at reducing the drudgery of cleaning data without even looking at it. Of which I’m highly skeptical. Automation is important, but so is actually doing the cleaning.

Cleaning is difficult and nuanced work, why do we treat it like laundry? We don’t give checklists for how to analyze data, do we? (Oh no, sometimes people apparently do …)

I never thought hard about data cleaning until this post. But as I looked at it critically, it’s became obvious to me that we’ve put an unpleasant label on top of a tedious, frustrating part of the data analysis process (who wants to do CLEANING, might as well call it “scooping the data kitty litter”). Then through layers of abstraction and poor education, we’ve lost track of how critical it is.

We then tell horror stories and have “concerning” research that 80%, 60%, 40%, whatever-percent of an expensive data scientist’s time is spent on cleaning data. The stat itself seems more a vague expression of direction than hard truth. Leigh Dodds wrote a more detailed look at that sketchy statistic here.

Whatever the actual truth of the claim is, the implication and call to action is clear — if we made the cleaning process easier, faster, automated, we’d hit Data Science Productivity NIRVANA. CEOs could save on headcount and salary. Every employee could do their own simple analyses from a slick GUI. Data scientists would be working on the sexy problems, use the bestest algorithms. There’d be overflowing wine goblets and insights will effortlessly rain from the heavens.

Silliness aside, pause and think about what data cleaning actually is. Not the mechanistic definition of “getting rid of errors to increase data quality”. Nor the end-goal justification of “having better data quality gives better results”. Let’s talk ontology.

We perform data cleaning because we suspect there’s useful signal about some topic we care about. For example, I suspect the volume of my tweets that complain goes up when an important deadlines looms. But my signal of interest is buried in plenty of noise and errors: my shitposting volume isn’t correlated w/ deadlines, my time zone changed over history. I downloaded the data in weird chunks so there might be holes. I write in two languages. I tweet a lot so I can’t read all the tweets and hand-code them.

We’re doing cleaning because we want to extract the useful signal from the noise, and we decide certain bits of noise “correctable” at the data point level for that purpose. Therefore, we clean those parts so that they don’t affect our analysis.

Wait, but that’s data analysis!
We just call it data cleaning because somehow it’s “not the real analysis I’m doing”, it’s “the stuff that comes before”. The Real Work™ is using algorithms with names, not “find and replace”. I’m just forced to do this menial labor step so that I can achieve my true glory as the bringer of truth.

This cleaning work is perceived to be mechanistic, and “not hard”. A high-schooler or RA could do this, and they cost factions of MY salary. But considering how complex a 16 year old human brain is, I don’t feel that way.

Here’s a very typical cleaning situation. Side note, The embed is ridiculously long so I’m screenshotting the original tweet here. Literally feels like scrolling through Philadelphia for miles.


The act of cleaning data is the act of preferentially transforming data so that your chosen analysis algorithm produces interpretable results. That is also the act of data analysis.
If our algorithms were so magical that we can just throw in raw text logs in and real insights falls out, guess what, we’d never clean. Our computers don’t care how ugly our data is — it’s all 1s and 0s. Regression will gladly spit out coefficients to whatever table of numbers you feed it. The real reason for all this cleaning work is the signal-to-noise ratio in raw data is too poor for purpose we intend. We need to improve data quality to amp the signal for our tools to find.

We do things like: decide that every user who misspelled Philadelphia still counts, even if they can’t spell their hometown. We don’t simply use ALL the model features because only 3 matter. We need to exclude users with profile XYZ because we gave them a special discount and they’d bias our A/B experiment on the sales page. All these users from France don’t count because we didn’t run our ad there. Duplicate events from bug#12345 need to be excluded or it’ll bias our results.

All of the above are instances where we’ve cleaned our data by making a decision. You might classify some as “cleaning” and some as “analysis”, but they’re all very similar classes of transformations. What gets labeled as “cleaning” vs “analysis” seems more a judgement of its value — the good stuff that makes us sound smart is called “analysis”.

But cleaning is mechanical. Analysis has intent!
Analysis implies that we’re searching for meaning. Wouldn’t cleaning, a step’s largely for “fixing quality issues” like typos and collection errors, have no analytical intent and this is the differentiating factor between the two?

Nope!

Because cleaning operations themselves impose value judgments upon the data. Going back to the Philadelphia example, it may seem obvious to you that all those misspellings should be grouped together and cleaned to be the same, correct value. As a frequent analyst of crappy data from open text boxes on the internet, that’s my automatic reaction upon seeing it. This is because the work I do generally wants all data from a given location to be grouped together.

But what if you’re doing a linguistic study? Those typos are actually extremely valuable to you. Normalizing that variation away would make any analysis on that front impossible. If we didn’t store the original data (which is recommended best practice that only some people follow), it would forever be lost.

Choosing to transform the data in any one way necessarily implies you’ve already chosen to do certain things with it, to the exclusion of others. It doesn’t matter if the changes are big (imputing missing values, removing entries) or small (removing trailing whitespace, normalizing date formats).

As an example, one of the largest data generation/collection systems on the planet, the Large Hadron Collider generates so much data it’s impossible to store in raw form. So physicists spent untold amounts of thinking and energy, drawing upon decades of domain-specific knowledge, to create custom algorithms to filter and preselect what to even record. It’s built to purpose—they literally designed and control the entire toolchain down to the hardware.

Some credit is due here: Reaffirming that nothing I ever write is new under the sun, halfway through writing this article, I tweeted about data cleaning and it went viral. Someone in the amazing Twitter data cluster pointed me to this publication from by Katie Rawson and Trevor Muñoz (2019).

It’s from the data humanities fields (a domain I didn’t even know existed despite doing some computational philosophy/sociology 15 years ago) that discusses very similar observations about data cleaning much more cogently. Very recommended read!

Also another great person linked me to this paper that compares two broad methods for cleaning data, imposing order upon the disordered. It also goes into how the the fields of economics and biology work to preserve the raw data, anticipating that things might need to be reclassified (re-cleaned) in the future.

And yet another awesome person pointed me to danah boyd’s work and this paper that discusses a lot of the critical issues with Big Data, including data cleaning. Pointing out that data cleaning is seen as trivial when it has enormous effects on what you can even say with a set of data. Also well worth a read.

Cleaning your data allows you to know your data
I firmly believe that knowing your data is critically important as a data scientist. It’s the one thing I tell everyone who asks me for advice. You can only make confident statements using your data when you know what’s been collected, what hasn’t been collected, how it’s collected, where are the gotchas, where are the hidden dependencies, etc.

The only way to get that level of familiarity is to do the hard work and get deeply familiar with the data set at hand. People usually attribute this work to be part of the “Exploratory Data Analysis” phase of analysis, but EDA often happens when the data has already been partially cleaned. Truly raw, unclean data often doesn’t even function properly within software, because something unexpected usually trips things up. Fixing those issues bring a huge amount of knowledge (and questions) about the data set. (Okay, astute readers would notice that this isn’t the only way, the best way to get ultimate familiarity with a data set is to actually collect the data yourself, but that’s a topic for another day.)

Most of us don’t work in rigorous institutions that carefully document every single detail about data collection like say, the US Census Bureau. Manuals that can answer minute questions about methodology, data quality, and cleanliness don’t exist in our world. Also, let’s be honest, how many of us who use the Census data actually read any of those documents? Definitely not me.

I’m going to put forth the claim that cleaning the data is a prerequisite to getting a rock solid understanding of the underlying data. If you delegate that responsibility someone else, whether it’s another human or a machine, you put yourself at risk of doing something dangerous with your data. The pragmatic question is how much risk we are willing to assume, and whether you’re even aware that you’re undertaking risk.

In many cases, the implications of that danger is small — few people normally care if you misinterpret the census data to make a bad map to tweet out. For expedience, you might be willing to trust that the Census did a good job maintaining high quality data and just accept that you might do something stupid because you didn’t read a footnote somewhere.

By taking the data quality to be good enough based entirely on trust, you can save time and skip ahead to EDA. That’s a pretty tempting position to take when using a well-known, reliable source for simple uses. But even with a trusted source, inconsistencies do exist and can be found later. Hopefully it doesn’t upset your findings.
